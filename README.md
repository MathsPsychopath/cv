# CV

In this repo, you can find my CV, the source HTML/CSS. For styling, I'm using Tailwind CSS as a CDN link, and Bootstrap for icons.

Serve locally with `python -m http.server` if you have python installed. Or use Live Server to view.

I'm using Chrome's print page "Save to PDF" option to export this HTML as a document.
